	So this is my homepage! I share some things in here that I find interesting,
	and also show my work in science, programming, hacking, and more. You can
	find some of my code at <a
		href="https://github.com/{{site.author.github}}">github</a>. You can
		also send me an email to <a
			href="mailto:{{site.author.email}}">{{site.author.email}}</a>.
	This site is in an eternal "under construction" state, but I try to make
	both the content and the URLs permanent, so I can link it myself from other
	places.
