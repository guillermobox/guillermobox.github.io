# Developing arpeen

I am documenting the development of this application. I have been thinking
long and hard about calculators, and how they evolved with computation. I
think the calculator, as a concept, was almost eliminated, forgotten. That is
not fair, those poor things helped everyone left and right, from regular
supermarket calculations, to high end complex engineering, including civil
engineering, finances, currency conversion. But the afordable computer came,
now we have laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, but we did not bring the
functionality with us.

The calculator did not evolve with technology much. The physical standalone
calculator got bigger, with more pixels, with more programming, but that I
would say just hindered the adoption. I am a programmer, and I hate
programming in those calculator. I can't think other people like much.

Most of the calculators found around do really implement some kind of algebra
that I find disgusting, where you push _sin_ and you get in the screen _sin(_
as if the calculator was some shortcut to write an algebraic expression.
Of course they have parenthesis also. Man...

The closest thing we have to a calculator in modern computing is, I think,
the excel spreadsheet. That's a sad future we are living in, and I will
change it.

The intention of *arpeen* is to reintroduce in the modern software ecosystem
the calculator as it should be:

 - Simple RPN interface
 - Domain driven
 - Flexible, growable
 - PC/Smartphone/Tablet ready

I will get deeper in these concepts as I implement them.
