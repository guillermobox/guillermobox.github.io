title: The island of blue and brown eyes

A particular island has 200 habitants. Half of them have blue eyes, the other
half have brown eyes. They don't want to live in the island, and there is a
ferry which takes them to a better place. The ferry leaves everyday at
midnight, with any habitant of the island who knows his/her eye color. This is
more difficult that it seems, because they are not allowed to communicate in any
way, and also there is no reflective surfaces to be found in the island. All of
the habitants want to leave, and they are well versed in logic and understand
the situation with the ferry and the eye color problem.

Today something extraordinary happens. A shaman appears in a mountain, all the
habitants gather around him, he looks at them, and says: I can see at least
one habitant with blue eyes. And then, he disapears.

The question: is any of the habitants going to leave the island? and if
that is the case, when?
