This is proposed as a continuation of the Cheryl's birthday problem,
but I think that this particular problem exited before the well known
Cheryl's problem. In any case, here it is, taken from Wikipedia:

Albert and Bernanrd now want to know how old Cheryl is.

Cheryl: I have two younger brothers. The product of all our ages (i.e. my age
and the ages of my two brothers) is 144, assuming that we use whole numbers for
our ages.

Albert: We still don't know your age. What other hints can you give us?

Cheryl: The sum of all our ages is the bus number of this bus that we are on.

Bernard: Of course we know the bus number, but we still don't know your age.

Cheryl: Oh, I forgot to tell you that my brothers have the same age.

Albert and Bernard: Oh, now we know your age!

So what is Cheryl's age?
