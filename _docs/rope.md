title: Two one hour ropes
date: 16/04/2018

This is a short riddle/mathematical problem. You have two ropes, and a lighter.
These two ropes have the characteristic that they need a full hour to burn once
lit up with the lighter. This burning is not necessarily uniform, meaning that
half the rope doesn't have to burn in half an hour. You don't have any control
regarding how fast the rope burns.

Your objective is to be able to measure exactly 45 minutes using those ropes and
the lighter provided.
