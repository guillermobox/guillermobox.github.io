Five pirates are arguing about how to share a tresaure, of 100 coins. They
are family, and they have an interesting method to decide the partition
that will apply.

The oldest pirate proposes a certain distribution of the coins, and
inmediately all the pirates (including him) vote to accept, or not, the
proposition. If half or more of the votes are positive, the partition will
be applied, otherwise, the pirate will be killed in a very gruesume and
piratesque way, and the process is repeated now with the oldest pirate.

All the pirates are experts on logic, they want to live, they also want to
maximize the coins that they will receive, and if they are in a situation that
their vote won't have an impact on the expected coins to receive, they prefeer
to vote negative in order to enjoy the guesome killing.

So the question is: what is the coin distribution proposed by the oldest
pirate which is successfully appied, taking into consideration the desires of
all the five pirates?
