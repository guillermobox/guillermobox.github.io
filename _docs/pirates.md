title: The five pirates riddle

Five pirates are arguing about how to share a tresaure, of 100 coins.  They have
an interesting method to decide the partition that will be used to distribute
the coints between them.

The oldest pirate proposes a certain distribution of the coins, and inmediately
all the pirates (including him) vote the proposition. When half or more of the
votes are positive, the partition is applied, the coins distributed, and that's
the happy ending. Otherwise, the pirate will be killed in a very gruesome and
*piratesque* way, and the process is repeated now with the oldest pirate.

All the pirates are experts on logic, they want to live, they also want to
maximize the coins that they will receive, and if they are in a situation that
their vote won't have an impact on the expected coins to receive, they prefeer
to vote negative in order to enjoy the gruesome killing.

So the question is: what is the coin distribution proposed by the oldest
pirate which is successfully applied, taking into consideration the desires of
all the five pirates?
