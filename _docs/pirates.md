title: The five pirates riddle

Five pirates have to share a 100 coins tresaure. These are 17th century Caribbean
pirates, so they have found the booty in an island or something. They will use
the traditional pirate method to decide how to distribute the coins between
them.

The method goes like this: the oldest pirate proposes a certain coin
distribution, and inmediately all the pirates including him vote the
proposition, secretly and without further communication. When half or more of
the votes are positive, the partition is accepted, the coins distributed, and
that's the happy ending. Otherwise, the pirate will be killed in a very gruesome
and *piratesque* way, and the process is repeated now with the oldest pirate.

You have to take some things in consideration: these pirates don't take
decisions lightly, the five of them are experts on logic, they want to live,
they also want to maximize the coins that they will receive, and if they are in
a situation that their vote won't have an impact on the ammount of coins they
will receive, they prefeer to vote negative in order to enjoy the gruesome
killing.

So the question is: what is the coin distribution proposed by the oldest
pirate which is successfully applied, taking into consideration the desires of
all the five pirates?
