title: Snow plowing math problem

This math problem is from IBM ponder this, slightly modified.

As you leave your house in the morning, you can feel the portent of snow in the
air. The weather report on the radio confirms your suspicions.

Sure enough, the snow begins to fall before noon-time, and falls at a constant
rate. The city sends out its first snow plow at noon which begins removing snow
at a constant rate (in cubic meter per minute.) At 1 P.M. it has gone 2
kilometers.  At 2 P.M. it has gone 3 kilometers, and is still not retracing its
path.

At what time did it start to snow?
