You are preparing a party, and you have invited all your friends. Because you
are an Instagram superstar, you have plenty of friends, so you bought
1000 bottles of wine. Also, probably because you are a superstar and people
get jealous around you, the delivery guy poisoned one bottle of wine.

The party starts in one hour, and you have 10 healthy mice in your house. I
don't think that is related to the Instagram in any way, but anyway, they
react to the poison like a human will do, so you decide to use them to find
the poisoned bottle. The problem is that the party starts in one hour,
you only have 10 mice, 1000 bottles to check, and the poison needs one
hour to do its effect. Nonetheless, the mice are capable of drinking all the
wine you give to them, and if a single drop has poison, they will die. And
they will go to the mice heaven, with Fievel, Jerry, and other famous mice.

So, how can you feed wine to the mice to find the poisoned bottle before the
party starts? You have to be sure of not serving the poisoned one, and you need
the other 999 bottles to feed your guests.
