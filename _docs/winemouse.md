title: 1000 wine bottles and a bunch of mice

You are preparing a party, and you have invited all your friends. Because you
are an Instagram superstar, you have plenty of friends, so you bought
1000 wine bottles. Also, probably because you are a superstar and people
get jealous around you, the delivery guy poisoned one of the bottles!

The party starts in one hour, and you have 10 healthy mice in your house. I
know is a little wierd, but anyway, they
react to the poison like a human would, so you decide to use them to find
the poisoned bottle. The problem is that the party starts in one hour,
you only have 10 mice, 1000 bottles to check, and the poison needs one
hour to do its effect. Nonetheless, the mice are capable of drinking all the
wine you give to them (they are french), and if a single drop has poison, they
will die. And they will go to the mice heaven, with Fievel, Jerry, and other
famous mice.

So, how can you feed wine to the mice to find the poisoned bottle before the
party starts? You have to be sure of not serving the poisoned one to your
guests, and you need the other 999 bottles to feed them.
