Inside a equilateral triangle we take an arbitrary point and join it with
the three vertices of the triangle, obtaining the sements a, b and c. Connecting
them we can create a new triangle. Express the internal angles of this new triangle
as a function of the angles alpha and beta, sustained by the original segments.
