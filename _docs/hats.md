In a weird prison managed by mathematicians, 10 prisioners are proposed the
following situation: they are going to be placed in a single row, each one
facing the one in front of him and not being allowed to turn around. The
prisioner at the start of the line can see all of the others, the one at the end
can see nobody. Each prisioner will then be assigned a hat, either red or blue.
The ammount of hats of each color is not known by the prisioners.

Then, starting from the prisioner at the start of the queue, and in order, they
have to say loudly 'red' or 'blue'. At the end of this process, if at least
9 prisioners have said the color of their hats correctly, they are free to
leave. Otherwise, they will be killed. They have time beforehand to come with a
proper strategy that allows them to survive. What is that strategy?
