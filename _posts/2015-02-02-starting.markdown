title: Hello world!

This is the first post in my blog.

I'm managing this by using jekyll to process the contents, and github pages to
host the site. I'm planning to upload some writings of mine, create some posts
to share my opinion, link my repositories with code and several articles from
scientific journals. Just a homepage, as several others around the world.

Writings posts in markdown, with a filesystem based database,
is a dream came true. The source code of this blog, including
the posts, css, javascript, layout and other data, is
hosted in a github
[repository](https://github.com/guillermobox/guillermobox.github.io).

That's it, I hope to work on this in the future.
