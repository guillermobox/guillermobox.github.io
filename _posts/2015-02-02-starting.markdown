This is the first post in my blog.

I'm managing this by using jekyll to process the contents,
and github pages to host the site. I'm planning to upload
some writings of mine, create some posts to share my stupid
opinion, link my repositories with code and several articles
from scientific journals.

Writings posts in markdown, with a filesystem based database,
is a dream come true. The source code of this blog, including
the posts, css, javascript, layout and other data, is
hosted in a github
[repository](https://github.com/guillermobox/guillermobox.github.io).
